As far as themes go, this one is pretty hard to install.. but that's still not saying much.

Method 1 (Easy) - Using Aegir:

Step 1 - Include the following in your make file (note that this is included in core-003.make and above for convenience):

projects[gibson_theme][type] = theme
projects[gibson_theme][download][type] = "git"
projects[gibson_theme][download][url] = "git://github.com/godel-design/gibson_theme.git"
projects[gibson_theme][subdir] = "custom"

Step 2: Point the theme folder at a new git repo before you start work on it - Please don't be committing your subsequent changes back to the communal gibson_theme repo

Step 3: Replace all instances of "gibson" in the project with the actual name of the client you're using this for. Make it lowercase, don't forget filenames.

Method 2 (Tedious) - Manual

Step 1: Install the Tao Theme - http://drupal.org/project/tao
Step 2: Upload gibson_theme to the relevant "themes/custom" folder (you may need to check it out of git first)
Step 4: Install the LESS Module - http://drupal.org/project/less
Step 5: Patch the LESS Module - http://drupal.org/node/1286754
Step 5: Replace all instances of "gibson" in the project with the actual name of the client you're using this for
Step 6: Point the theme folder at a new git repo
