This is a template for creating a Drupal 6 Installation Profile. It contains a set of Contrib module that make up an
"extended core" by defacto (we use them in most projects).

The profile is intended to be built using drush and profiler, see the README.txt files for those projects for more information.

There is more detailed information about the intended use-case and workflow in the Godel documentation wiki at docs.godeldesign.com.au

Currently the profile is designed to be cloned and modified, but it may be reinterpreted as a "base profile" that "sub profiles" can be built directly on top of for convenience in future releases.
